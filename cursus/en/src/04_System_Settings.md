The settings `cursus.extended_event_participant_fields`,
`cursus.extended_trainer_fields` and `cursus.extended_user_fields` can use
`@FILE` or `@CHUNK` bindings. Path placeholders like `{core_path}`,
`{base_path}` and `{assets_path}` can be used. All paths have to stay inside the
MODX base path because of security reasons. These settings have to be filled
according to [extended fields](07_Extended_Fields.md) documentation.
