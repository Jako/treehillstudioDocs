## Placeholders

The following placeholders are available in the different (default) chunks.
Also, each snippet property will be set as placeholder in each template chunk,
i.e. a snippet call ```[[!CursusEventCalendar? &subtitle=`whatever`]]``` will fill
the placeholder subtitle in each used chunk with the value `whatever`.

**CAUTION:** The default template chunks for both snippets are overwritten
during each package update, so please rename the chunks before editing them.
