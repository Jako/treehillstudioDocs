title: Installation
---

The MODX installer should install the package automatically from the modmore
repository.

A custom manager page called _Cursus_ is installed within the _Extras_ menu.
Also, some [snippets](05_Snippets/index.md) in the element category named
_Cursus_ are created.

There are some system settings available in the namespace _cursus_. These can
also be edited in the [settings](03_Custom_Manager_Page/07_Settings.md) (cog
icon) tab of the _Cursus_ custom manager page.

After the installation you have to set up a cronjob, if you want to send the
mails of _Cursus_ with the built-in mail queue, automatically remove
reservations or send reminder mails.
