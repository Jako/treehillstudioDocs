title: Tab Participants
---

This tab contains a paginated grid with all participants.

![Participants Grid](img/participants.png)

You can create a new participant with a click on the create participant button
on the top left above the participants grid.

If the manger user has a `cursus_export_participants` permission an export is
displayed right of the create participant button. This allows the user to
[export](../08_Export.md) the participants.

It can be filtered by events. It can also be filtered by a search entry at the
top right above the participants grid.

The row of each participant shows the fullname, the company, the adddress, the
zip and the city of an entry. If the [extended user
fields](../07_Extended_Fields.md) are set, the columns of those extended fields
are shown before the icon column.

Each participant can be edited by clicking on the edit icon in the participant's
row. It can be deleted after confirmation by clicking on the trash icon in the
row of the participant.

## Create/Edit

The edit window for one participant has a lot of fields, that can be changed.
